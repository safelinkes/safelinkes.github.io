                        <br><br>
                        Actualy internet activity is not safe. There are many attacker out there which is wants to try
                        stealing important information in every website.

                    </p>
                    <h3>What is the internet bot?</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the internet world, internet bot means a robot which is running automatically by script which
                        is running in server side.
                        Most of this bot activity is to get all of information from your website. For the good bot, it
                        will make benefit for you website, but for a bad bot this can harm your website.
                        So you have to be careful of this.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What is the crawler?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Crawler is similar like the internet bot, but the difference is that crawler is mostly to read
                        your website structure, then they keep of this information into their website.
                        Crawler can slowdown your site because, most of them is run automatically scheduled, and the
                        speed is very faster than human being.
                        You have to be careful of this, because your server sometimes can be down because of this
                        crawler.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What is the scrapper?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Scrapper also similar like the crawler, but the difference is scrapper is just trying to make
                        your site as the point of their data.
                        Most of scrapper is to steal you website information then they make your website as database or
                        an api service to their website.
                        Also many of them using this scrapper technique to clone your site as same as possible. You have
                        to becareful of this activity, because scrapper sometimes can make your page rank go down.
                    </p>
